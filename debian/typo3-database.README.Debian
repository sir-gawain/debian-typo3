TYPO3 for Debian
-----------------

WHAT IS THIS PACKAGE FOR?
=========================

This package contains an empty TYPO3 database structure and provides a
dependency to the mysql server package.

Q: Why did you make another package and didn't use typo3-dummy as before?

A: The problem with integrating the database dependency into typo3-dummy is
that all people who want to use this package are forced to install a full
mysql server. But as everyone knows the database can/should be installed on a
separate server to get some level of load balancing. Thats why typo3-database
was created and typo3-dummy only suggests its installation. This way the
packages can be installed on different machines without pulling too much into
the systems.

Q: Why do you provide an empty database? TYPO3 can create that itself.

A: Yeah, i know. But using the mechanisms of TYPO3 means, that the user does
not have a working installation of TYPO3 after installing these packages. He
has to enter the install tool and to configure the database by hand.
This can be a bit challanging for new users, so i want to make the installation
of TYPO3 as simple as possible and provide an empty database.


LOCAL INSTALLATION
==================

The local installation is really trival:

* first step: install this package before typo3-dummy and answer the questions
during installation like this:
1) Configure the database typo3-database with dbconfig-common? YES.
2) Enter the password for the database system administration account.
3) Choose a new password for the TYPO3 database account.

Thats all.
The install script now creates a new database user "typo3-database" with
your chosen password and imports the database dump into the database.

* second step: install the package typo3-dummy and anwser the only question
for the password with your chosen one from above.

The install script now checks whether the password is correct or not, and
if it is correct the connection parameters are saved for later use.

You are done.


REMOTE INSTALLATION
===================

The remote installation is similar to the local one but has a third step
to accomplish.

* first step: install this package on the remote (database) machine, before
you install typo3-dummy. Follow the steps 1-3 from above.

* second step: install the package typo3-dummy and anwser the only question
for the password with your chosen one from above. Note, that you cannot
choose the database host here, this is done next.

* third step: reconfigure typo3-dummy using the priority "low":
> dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low --force typo3-dummy
Now you can answer a lot of question regarding your remote machine.

You are done.

PS: Make sure, your firewalls let you access the remote database!


Feel free to send me your package-specific comments or suggestions.
