typo3-dummy for Debian
----------------------

The required steps to install the database with TYPO3 are described in
/usr/share/doc/typo3-database/README.Debian. That file contains additional
information, too.

URIs of the backend
-------------------

Depending on the method of integration you choose during installation, the
TYPO3 backend is either available under
http://[typo3.your.domain]/typo3
or
http://[www.domain.name]/cms/typo3


Situations of time out or out-of-memory
---------------------------------------

If you encounter situations during work where TYPO3/PHP complains about a
skript timeout or insufficient memory, you can tune the following parameters
to fix the problems:

* In /etc/typo3-dummy/LocalConfiguration.php look for the line
  'setMemoryLimit' => '128',
  and adjust the memory limit to a higher value.
* In /etc/typo3-dummy/apache-*.conf look for the line
  php_admin_value memory_limit 48M
  and adjust the memory limit to a higher value.

* In /etc/typo3-dummy/apache-*.conf look for the line
  # php_admin_value max_execution_time 90
  and remove the '#' and adjust the time limit to a higher value.

Don't forget to restart your apache to make the changes active.


TYPO3-Scheduler
---------------

The new TYPO3 scheduler extension is based on a cron task.
You can find the task in /etc/cron.d/typo3-dummy.
Adjust the interval of the task to your own needs. The default is 5 minutes.
See the scheduler extension manual for futher information.


Enable the usage of cache framework
-----------------------------------

To make use of the new cache framework change the following line in
/etc/typo3-dummy/LocalConfiguration.php:
'useCachingFramework' => '0',
to
'useCachingFramework' => '1',


Better performance for memcached
--------------------------------

In his blog Dmitry Dulepov proposed this settings for memcached to get
some more performance out of memcached:

memcache.allow_failover         1
memcache.chunk_size             32768
memcache.default_port           11211
memcache.hash_function          fnv
memcache.hash_strategy          consistent
memcache.max_failover_attempts  20

for the original post.
