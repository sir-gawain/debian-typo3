typo3-src (4.3.8+dfsg1-1)

  * typo3/contrib/jsmin/jsmin.php contains code that is under a non free
    license -> DFSG #6 "No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor".
    This file has been removed from orig.tgz and the only file refencing it
    (typo3-src-4.3.8/t3lib/class.t3lib_div.php) has been patched to not
    use it anymore.
