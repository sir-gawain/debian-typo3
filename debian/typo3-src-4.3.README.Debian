TYPO3 for Debian
----------------

This package is the master package to install TYPO3 for Debian.


NEWBIE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TYPO3 FILESYSTEM STRUCTURE
=======================================================

A Unix TYPO3 installation consists of two parts:
     1) The "source" package
     2) The "dummy" package

The dummy package contains the skeleton directory structure for a TYPO3
installation and a symlink ('typo3_src') to the location of the source
package which contains all the PHP files, images, JavaScript files, etc.
that TYPO3 needs to run.

In other words: You can have several TYPO3 installations with just one
source package. A typical directory structure looks like this:

/usr/share/typo3/typo3_src-3.8.1/   # the untared 3.8.0 source package
/usr/share/typo3/typo3_src-4.1/     # the untared 4.1 source package
/var/www/installation1/     # the untared dummy package of a TYPO3
                            # installation running on TYPO3 3.8.1
    /typo3_src  --> /usr/share/typo3/typo3_src-3.8.1/   # a symlink to the 3.8.1
    /typo3conf/                                         # source
    /typo3temp/
    /fileadmin/
    /.../
/var/www/installation2/     # the untared dummy package of a TYPO3
                            # installation running on TYPO3 4.1
    /typo3_src  --> /usr/share/typo3/typo3_src-4.1/     # a symlink to the 4.1
    /typo3conf/                                         # source
    /typo3temp/
    /fileadmin/
    /.../

As you see, the two TYPO3-installations (possibly with different domains)
can use the same TYPO3 source package. You can even change the source
package simply be changing the symlink inside the installation directory.


MANUAL INSTALL TYPO3 IN YOUR RUNNING APACHE
===========================================

The following eight steps are necessary to get started with TYPO3 with
the provided Debian packages:

1 Install typo3-dummy 

2 Check that the PHP itself and the extensions gd and mysql are enabled.

  To load mod_php5 check that the following symlinks are set:

  # cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled; ls -l php5*
  php5.conf -> /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf
  php5.load -> /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.load


  The PHP configuration file php.ini (/etc/php5/apache[2]/php.ini)
  should contain the following lines:

  # grep -v '\;' /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini | grep 'extension='
  extension=gd.so
  extension=mysql.so

  Please note: newer versions of php packages in debian handle the addition
  of modules through the directory /etc/php5/conf.d. So make sure, gd.ini
  and mysql.ini are in that directory if you cannot find the above two lines
  in your php.ini.

3 Enabling the webserver to use the provided directories.

  The database packages builds a directory that can be used as
  DocumentRoot within a (virtual)host or as directory within an
  existing host. An example configuration for the Apache is located in
  /etc/typo3-dummy/apache.conf.

  WARNING: The configuration that will be enabled through the
  following steps is meant for the configuration of TYPO3 and not for a
  production environment.  It is necessary to disable the TYPO3 1-2-3
  install tool standard login before going into production.  The 1-2-3
  install tool gives appropriate advice.

  For Apache 2.x this may be achieved through:
  # cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
  # ln -s /etc/typo3-dummy/apache.conf typo3-dummy
  # cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
  # ln -s ../sites-available/typo3-dummy .
  
  Please check that the configuration meets your needs. Don't forget
  to reload the apache configuration, e.g. through:
  # /etc/init.d/apache2 reload


4 Fix permissions

  The provided example configuration for the apache uses the PHP safe
  mode. Therefor it is necessary to change the ownership of the used
  files to WWWUSER/WWWGROUP.  In Debian standard configuration these
  are set to www-data/www-data.


5 Prepare the MySQL access

  Create empty databases for the packages, e.g.
  # mysqladmin create typo3-dummy

  Grants access to these databases for a local user, e.g.
  # mysql --exec="GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \
     \`typo3-dummy\`.* TO 'typo3'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass' ; "


6 Using a browser, visit http://[your.site.name]/<this_site_name>/

  Using the standard Debian configuration access to the 1-2-3 install
  tool is gotten by pointing the browser to
  http://localhost/typo3/

  The standard password for the install tool is joh316. Be sure to
  change it, before connecting to the Internet!

  If a normal page is delivered, the 1-2-3 install tool may be accessed
  directly
  http://localhost/typo3/typo3/install/


7 Following the instructions in the 1-2-3 install tool will lead
  quickly to the TPYO3 site.


8 From this point, you can access the backend through
  http://[your.site.name]/<this_site_name>/typo3/
  with the username "admin" and password "password".
  
  For example:
  http://localhost/typo3/typo3/

  Remember to change the admin password and to protect the install
  tool access mentioned above.

That's it :-)


AND NOW ?
=========

There are two packages on typo3.org website that are provided to demonstrate
the ablities of typo3: quickstart and testside.
It's proposed to deliver these packages through EM in the near future but in 
the meantime you have to install them manually.
Take a look on <http://typo3.org/download/packages/> for more information.


WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?
=========================================

Here are some typical pitfalls:

1 - Error message '/var/lib/typo3*/typo3conf/localconf.php is missing'
    is displayed in your browser

    This is normally a symptom for not setting all the file to the
    right user and group. Execute the typo3-site-installer to fix the
    permissions at it is described above.

2 - Check the symlink "typo3_src" in the directory which should point to
    the source directory, e.g.

    # file /var/lib/typo3-dummy/typo3_src
    /var/lib/typo3-dummy/typo3_src:       symlink to `/usr/share/typo3/typo3_src-4.3'


WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF PROBLEM STILL REMAINS?
============================================

TYPO3 is a powerful and complex professional application. When you start
out there will be many things you don't understand, or that don't seem to
make sense. There is a widely used mailing list (more information on
typo3.com & typo3.org) where many experienced users and developers
lurk... they are always willing to help, provided you followed these steps
BEFORE you ask your question:

1 - Read all available documentation carefully

2 - Read all available documentation again

3 - Search the mailing list archive carefully

4 - If you still can't figure it out - ask the list...:
      - Debian specific: news://news.netfielders.de/typo3.install.debian
      - Newsgroup:       news://news.netfielders.de/
      - Mailing lists:   http://lists.netfielders.de/

    When posting to one of the lists, see the following guidelines...
      - Be polite
         Always include the version of used TYPO3 and server environment
         (phpinfo())... note that this is available within the TYPO3
         Install Tool
      - Be as specific and clear as possible - questions like "my TYPO3
         installation does not work - what can I do???" will be ignored.
         Although English may not be your first language, if those reading
         your posting can't understand it, you won't get the help you need
      - If you are really having a tough time getting something working,
         stay cool and don't criticise or flame. Problems are normally
         caused by lack of research into the documentation, or
         misunderstanding, not because of bugs. Be logical about your
         troubleshooting, and you'll get there

5 - If you have identified a bug, related to the packing report it to
    Debian Bug Tracking System, e.g. using a tool like reportbug.

6 - If you have identified a genuine new bug, report it at
    http://bugs.typo3.org/ ...do not post to the list about it

Please be aware that if you ask questions that are answered in the
available documentation, you may not get a reply, or any help from the
developers or any experienced users!

We are aware that there is still some work to be done on the
documentation, and the platform for user support... please forgive us for
not having all these gaps filled. If you feel that some information is
missing, hard to find or just plain wrong, or you have a suggestion on
improving TYPO3 or the "support services", please let us know so that we
can do what is necessary. You could also volunteer to help with the work!
