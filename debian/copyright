 A SOURCE CODE VERSION OF CERTAIN THUNDERBIRD E-MAIL FUNCTIONALITY THAT YOU MAY
 USE, MODIFY AND DISTRIBUTE IS AVAILABLE TO YOU FREE-OF-CHARGE FROM
 WWW.MOZILLA.ORG UNDER THE MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE and other open source software
 licenses.
 The accompanying executable code version of Mozilla Thunderbird and related
 documentation (the "Product") is made available to you under the terms of this
 MOZILLA THUNDERBIRD END-USER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE "AGREEMENT").  BY
 CLICKING THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR BY INSTALLING OR USING THE MOZILLA THUNDERBIRD
 E-MAIL CLIENT, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT
 AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT CLICK THE "ACCEPT"
 BUTTON, AND DO NOT INSTALL OR USE ANY PART OF THE MOZILLA THUNDERBIRD E-MAIL
 CLIENT.
 DURING THE MOZILLA THUNDERBIRD INSTALLATION PROCESS, AND AT LATER TIMES, YOU
 MAY BE GIVEN THE OPTION OF INSTALLING ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS FROM THIRD-PARTY
 SOFTWARE PROVIDERS.  THE INSTALLATION AND USE OF THOSE THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS
 MAY BE GOVERNED BY ADDITIONAL LICENSE AGREEMENTS.
 1. LICENSE GRANT. The Mozilla Foundation grants you a non-exclusive license to
 use the executable code version of the Product.  This Agreement will also
 govern any software upgrades provided by Mozilla that replace and/or supplement
 the original Product, unless such upgrades are accompanied by a separate
 license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.
 2.  TERMINATION.  If you breach this Agreement your right to use the Product
 will terminate immediately and without notice, but all provisions of this
 Agreement except the License Grant (Paragraph 1) will survive termination and
 continue in effect.  Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the
 Product.
 3.  PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.  Portions of the Product are available in source code
 form under the terms of the Mozilla Public License and other open source
 licenses (collectively, "Open Source Licenses") at http://www.mozilla.org.
 Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to limit any rights granted under
 the Open Source Licenses.  Subject to the foregoing, Mozilla, for itself and on
 behalf of its licensors, hereby reserves all intellectual property rights in
 the Product, except for the rights expressly granted in this Agreement.  You
 may not remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary
 notice in or on the Product.  This license does not grant you any right to use
 the trademarks, service marks or logos of Mozilla or its licensors.
 4.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS.
 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MOZILLA AND MOZILLA'S LICENSORS HEREBY DISCLAIM
 ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
 WARRANTIES THAT THE PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGING.  YOU BEAR ENTIRE RISK AS TO SELECTING
 THE PRODUCT FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 PRODUCT.  THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
 PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.   SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
 LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 5.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, MOZILLA AND ITS
 DIRECTORS, LICENSORS, CONTRIBUTORS AND AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "MOZILLA
 GROUP") WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
 OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
 THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
 DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, AND
 COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH
 SUCH CLAIM IS BASED.  THE MOZILLA GROUP'S COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER THIS
 AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $500 (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS) AND THE
 FEES PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS LICENSE (IF ANY).  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO
 THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 6.  EXPORT CONTROLS.  This license is subject to all applicable export
 restrictions.  You must comply with all export and import laws and restrictions
 and regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority relating to
 the Product and its use.
 7.  U.S. GOVERNMENT END-USERS.  The Product is a "commercial item," as that
 term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer
 software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are
 used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995) and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202 (June 1995).
 Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212, 48 C.F.R. 27.405(b)(2) (June 1998) and 48
 C.F.R. 227.7202, all U.S. Government End Users acquire the Product with only
 those rights as set forth herein.
 8.  MISCELLANEOUS.  (a) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between
 Mozilla and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and it may only be
 modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Mozilla.
 (b) Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this
 Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A.,
 excluding its conflict of law provisions.  (c) This Agreement will not be
 governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
 Sale of Goods.  (d) If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or
 unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties' original
 intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.  (e) A
 waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach
 thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any
 subsequent breach thereof.  (f) Except as required by law, the controlling
 language of this Agreement is English.  (g) You may assign your rights under
 this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its
 terms; the Mozilla Foundation may assign its rights under this Agreement
 without condition.  (h) This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to
