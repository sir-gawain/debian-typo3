TYPO3 CMS
===============================================================================

TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released
under the GNU GPL. TYPO3 is copyright (c) 1999-2014 by Kasper Skaarhoj.

This document provides a basic introduction to TYPO3.


===============================================================================
1. Getting Started
===============================================================================

If you are new to TYPO3 it's strongly recommended that you first download and
install the Introduction Package. The Introduction Package gives a broad
overview of the common features of a TYPO3 installation, and can also be used
for the very first website by customizing colors and logos. A custom setup
guides the user through the installation. A default website with a clean XHTML
template with dozens of pages is created. The TypoScript configuration that is
provided with the package also serves as a best practice guide. Just download,
install and check out what best practices are for building a TYPO3 website.

TYPO3 requires a webserver with PHP and a database (MySQL recommended).
Accessing the backend through a supported browser.

Please see the INSTALL.txt in this folder in order to set up a basic TYPO3
installation on your webserver.

  You can download the Introduction Package and installer packages here:

  You can find a great tutorial for the Introduction Package on typo3.org:

2. What is TYPO3?
===============================================================================

TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework. It is released
under the GNU General Public License. It can run on several web servers, such
as Apache or IIS, on top of many operating systems, among them Linux, Microsoft
Windows, FreeBSD or MacOS X.

TYPO3 was initially authored by Kasper Skårhøj and is now further developed
by a community of Active Contributors around a small TYPO3 CMS Team.

===============================================================================
3. What is a Content Management Framework?
===============================================================================

A Content Management Framework is more than just a content management system,
due to the separation of the streamlined core and optional plugins
(extensions). TYPO3 has an open API that allows you to extend the frontend (web
site) and/or backend (administration) functionalities.

The concept of extensions makes TYPO3 capable of being developed and used
in almost any way you can imagine, either by using any of the many extensions
which are available for download, or by writing your own.


===============================================================================
4. The TYPO3 core requirements
===============================================================================

TYPO3 is based upon PHP and uses a MySQL database. For more information
regarding these requirements see the INSTALL.txt file in this folder.

Using the Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL) allows one to use TYPO3 with other
Database Management Systems, like PostgreSQL, Oracle and MSSQL.


===============================================================================
5. Get more information
===============================================================================

  http://typo3.org is the main project website. It provides up to
  date official news, information about events, access to downloading the
  products and extensions.

  http://wiki.typo3.org is a collaborative wiki, providing access to
  all kind of information around the TYPO3 ecosphere.

  http://www.typo3.org/documentation: TYPO3 is one of the most thoroughly
  documented OpenSource products around, with manuals covering basic
  tutorials, TypoScript, administration, development, core structure, etc.
  You should make the time to locate the various documents, and read those
  that apply to the work you want to do.


===============================================================================
6. Exchange information, get help
===============================================================================

The community and all TYPO3 teams communicate through newsgroups, which can
also be accessed through mailing lists and forums. Any of these three ways
provide access to the same communication channels:

  Forum (Web): http://forum.typo3.org/
  Mailing Lists (Mail): http://typo3.org/support/mailing-lists/
  Newsgroups (NNTP): news://lists.typo3.org/


===============================================================================
7. Participate in the development
===============================================================================

If you want to file a bug report, maintain your own extension using our
infrastructure (Git, Issue Tracker, Wiki, etc), take a look at:

  http://forge.typo3.org

If you want to contribute to the TYPO3 CMS source code, take a look at our
Contributors Walkthrough:

===============================================================================
8. Chat with us
===============================================================================

Several teams use IRC as a way to communicate internally and most channels
are a welcome place for you to join and get yourself involved.

9. Some final notes
===============================================================================

TYPO3 is said to be one of the most sophisticated PHP / Internet related
applications available, and the more you play with it, the more you will agree.

Due to the advanced level of the code and functionality, a degree of study,
time and perseverance is required to fully understand it, and get the best from
it. You should keep trying, as we say it's definitely worth it. TYPO3 is the
Enterprise Content Management System "for all".

The GPL license allows for developments that are based upon TYPO3 to also be
freely available under the GPL. Please remember this, because TYPO3 is about
"Inspiring People To Share". If you are making money with TYPO3 you can donate
or become a member of the TYPO3 Association.

By becoming a supporting member, individuals and organisations mainly fund
core development of TYPO3. The decision about what the funds are used for, is
made by all members of the Association and the Expert Advisory Board (EAB).
The decisions will be made transparent to the community and especially the
supporting members. Your funds will also serve for other purposes as laid
out in the bylaws.
