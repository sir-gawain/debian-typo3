Authentication Services
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this version the authentication chain has been cleaned up so that third
party authentication services can benefit from RSA encrypted login without the
need of decrypting the submitted password in their own code.

The system extension rsaauth will now decrypt the password and provide the
decrypted version for other services. So external authentication services can
access the clear text password always through $this->loginData['uident_text'],
no matter if the password has been transmitted as plain text during the login
or rsaauth has decrypted it.

Due to major changes in the login service of rsaauth, all extensions which
use XCLASS to extend that class, most likely will fail, whereas other extension
which make proper use of the public API of the system extension rsaauth will
continue working without any problem.
In any case, it is recommended to adjust external authentication services to
benefit from the changes.

See new chapter in TYPO3 services documentation (doc_core_services) about the
topic of authentication services: http://forge.typo3.org/issues/31413
