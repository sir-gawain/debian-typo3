"System" extensions for TYPO3
This is also a global repository for extensions in TYPO3, just like the global extensions (in typo3/ext/)
System extensions cannot (by default at least) be updated like global and local extensions; They are meant to always be distributed with the core (while global extensions
in ext/ are not) and to the user they will probably be understood more like a part of the core since they come along with the core. But technically they are extensions for various reasons.

System Extensions are in the TYPO3core SVN module.
System Extensions should be hidden in TER (last check of this was oct. 2005 by kasper)

System extensions with manuals are currently (oct 2005):
- css_styled_content
- indexed_search
