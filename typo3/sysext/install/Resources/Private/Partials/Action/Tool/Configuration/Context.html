				TYPO3 can be run in a specific application context by using one of the
				built-in contexts "Production" (default), "Development" or "Testing".
				This can be used to provide specific configuration sets for each context.
				The context can be defined with the environment variable "TYPO3_CONTEXT"
				which is usually set through your webserver configuration (e.g. in htaccess).
			</p>
			<p>
				However, if you don't set a context environment variable, you can still
				use the install tool to select a configuration preset for "Production"
				or "Development" context. The goal is to configure a production instance
				with maximum performance and no debug output that is possibly shown to users,
				while development instances should enable error output. The configuration
				preset for "Production" is set by default.
				As a third alternative, you can enter a custom configuration.
