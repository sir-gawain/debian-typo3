	<h4>How to configure TYPO3</h4>
	<p>
		Local configuration is done by overriding default values in the
		included file, typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php. In this file you enter the
		database information along with values in the global array
		TYPO3_CONF_VARS.
		<br />
		The options in the TYPO3_CONF_VARS array and how to use it for your
		own purposes is discussed in the base configuration file,
		EXT:core/Configuration/DefaultConfiguration.php. This file sets up the default values and
		subsequently includes the LocalConfiguration.php file in which you can then
		override values.
		<br />
		See this page for <i:constant name="TYPO3_URL_SYSTEMREQUIREMENTS" /> more
		information about system requirements.</a>

	<h4>Using this script</h4>
	<p>
		There are three primary steps for you to take:
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>1: Basic Configuration</strong>
		<br />
		In this step your PHP-configuration is checked. If
		there are any settings that will prevent TYPO3 from
		running correctly you'll get warnings and errors
		with a description of the problem.
		<br />
		You'll have to enter a database username, password
		and hostname. Then you can choose to create a new
		database or select an existing one.
		<br />
		Finally the image processing settings are entered
		and verified and you can choose to let the script
		update the configuration with the suggested settings.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>2: Database Analyser</strong>
		<br />
		In this step you can either install a new database
		or update the database from any previous TYPO3
		version.
		<br />
		You can also get an overview of extra/missing
		fields/tables in the database compared to a raw
		sql-file.
		<br />
		The database is also verified against your
		configuration ($TCA) and you can
		even see suggestions for entries in $TCA or new
		fields in the database.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>3: Upgrade Wizard</strong>
		<br />
		Here you will find update methods taking care of
		changes to the TYPO3 core which are not backwards
		compatible.
		<br />
		It is recommended to run this wizard after every
		update to make sure everything will still work
		flawlessly.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>4: Image Processing</strong>
		<br />
		This step is a visual guide to verify your
		configuration of the image processing software.
		<br />
		You'll be presented to a list of images that should
		all match in pairs. If some irregularity appears,
		you'll get a warning. Thus you're able to track an
		error before you'll discover it on your website.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>5: All Configuration</strong>
		<br />
		This gives you access to any of the configuration
		options in the TYPO3_CONF_VARS array. Every option
		is also presented with a comment explaining what it
		does.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>6: Cleanup</strong>
		<br />
		Here you can clean up the temporary files in typo3temp/
		folder and the tables used for caching of data in
		your database.
	</p>

		<br />
		This indicates a <em>potential</em> error.
	</p>

	<h4 class="typo3-message message-error">
		Error!
	</h4>
	<p>
