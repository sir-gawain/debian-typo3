/**
 * Contract for a validator. This interface has drastically changed with Extbase 1.4.0, so that's why this interface does not contain any mandatory methods.
 *
 * For compatibility with Extbase < 1.4.0, the following methods need to exist:
 * - setOptions($options) to set validation options
 * - isValid($object) to check whether an object is valid (returns boolean value)
 * - getErrors() to get errors occuring during validation.
 *
 * For Extbase >= 1.4.0, the following methods need to exist:
 * - __construct($options) to set validation options
 * - validate($object) to check whether the given object is valid. Returns a Tx_Extbase_Error_Result object which can then be checked for validity.
 *
 * Please see the source file for proper documentation of the above methods.
