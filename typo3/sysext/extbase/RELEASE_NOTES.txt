RELEASE NOTES of Extbase v1.0.0
===============================

This package contains the Extbase Framework for Extensions. You may 
also want to install the BlogExample (blog_example) to experiment 
with. This little example extension demonstrates some of the main 
features of Extbase. The documentation is bundled in a separate 
extension called doc_extbase. Both, the blog_example and the 
doc_extbase can downloaded via TER.

Currently Extbase is in ALPHA state. Do not expect everything in the 
right place and shape. And keep in mind that the API may change 
until TYPO3 v4.3beta1 is released.

If you have any feature requests or encountered issues regarding 
this package please use the facilities on forge to report.

We are very open to answer your questions. Please use the newsgroup 

typo3.projects.typo3v4mvc on lists.netfielders.de

so other developers can react to your comments and also 
profit from the postet solutions. Do not contact a member of the 
development team via private email (or skype, or visits, or ...) 
until he accepted this channel. We all do coding for Extbase on 
our sparetime and must handle our regular work load - and don't 
forget about our families ;-).

We hope you have fun with this package!
